# SocialMediaFeed

A web application where user can see new posts even without logging in, once logged
in, they can create, read, update, and delete posts. Users can perform tasks based on
their admin and theme management roles.

Programming Technologies: PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Html

Framework: Laravel, Bootstrap

IDE and tools: Php Storm, MySQL workbench, GitHub

Deployment: Heroku and AWS

Created a web application in PHP using Laravel application framework that serve as a
custom Social media feed site. An administrative back-end area, the basic structure (i.e.
users, posts, themes) of a website can be dynamically created and modified by only
authorized users with the appropriate permissions. The additions and changes to the
siteâ€™s administrative structure will all be stored in the custom MySQL databases that will
create to support the Social Media Feed site.

Front-end

A front-end site area used bootstrap for design which will dynamically display posts
based on the structure stored in the database. The front-end site will be viewable by all
users including guests, but users can register and on subsequent visits log in to be able
to contribute and make some changes to feed content. For the deployment I used
Heroku and AWS student associate database, work is committed and pushed to GitHub
after completing tasks. By doing this project I learned larval such how to create and use
model, view, controller. Moreover, php artisan tinker was very helpful where I ran various
database queries.
